# BFS-Visualization
A simple visualization for the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS)


The breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a tree or graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the treeâ€™s root or graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems in graph theory.

To run the project type: python BFS_Visualized.py.


To try different test cases, read the comments at the end of the file.
